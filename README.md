Odin Project JS Foundations Rock Paper Scissors Project

This is my first project using JavaScript. The goal is to create logic in JS that will function as a Rock Paper Scissors game.

Some of the goals of this project are to:

    -Create pseudocode that will guide the process of creating functionable code in JS.

    -Link external .js in html code.

    -Create function called 'computerPlay' to randomaly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'.

    -Use 'computerPlay' function in the game as the computer's turns.

    -Create function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors that contains to parameters, 'playerSelection' and 'computerSelction'.

    -Prior function should be able to return a string declaring the winner of the round.

    -'playerSelection' parameter should be case-insensitive.

    -Results should call, console.log() should not have to be utilized to see the results.

    -Create 'game()' function that calls a 'playRound' function.

    -Utilize loops in order to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner and/or loser at the end of the game.

    -Utilize prompt() to collect input from user.
